# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Resolve the target through environment-workflow; use native Copilot app operations when required by the runtime, otherwise the `gh` CLI with an explicit target. Commands below describe supported operations, not blanket permission to execute them. Check installed CLI help for newer flags.

Every `gh issue` and `gh pr` example below must include `--repo <verified-owner/repo>`; target API operations at the verified host too. Configure wayfinding labels, claim permissions, and decision/implementation completion predicates during setup. Example labels are not evidence they exist, and closing an issue as rejected does not deliver its work.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --repo <owner/repo> --title "..." --body-file <path>`. Follow applicable issue templates. Use a temporary body file or PowerShell here-string on Windows, not a bash heredoc.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --json number,title,body,labels,comments`.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Make an issue a sub-issue of a parent**: `gh issue create --parent <parent> ...`, or `gh issue edit <parent> --add-sub-issue <child>` afterwards (`gh` 2.94+). Older `gh`: `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<parent>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=<child-db-id>` (database id, as in **Blocking** below). Without sub-issues, put `Part of #<parent>` at the top of the child body.
- **Blocking**: GitHub's **native issue dependencies**, the canonical, UI-visible representation. Add an edge with `gh issue create --blocked-by <n>,<n> ...` or `gh issue edit <child> --add-blocked-by <blocker>` (`gh` 2.94+). Older `gh`: `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`, where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .id`, _not_ the `#number` or `node_id`). Where dependencies aren't available, use a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line only under an agreed fallback policy and report it as textual, not native. A blocker must satisfy the project's successful-completion predicate, not merely be closed.
- **Count open blockers**: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by` counts open blockers only. Zero is not proof of startability: inspect closed blockers' reasons and delivery evidence against the configured predicate. `gh issue view <n> --json blockedBy` can supply the blockers for that inspection.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: post the explanation with `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`, then `gh issue close <number>`. On an already-closed issue, `gh issue close --comment` drops the comment and still exits 0.

Resolve the host, fork/base identity and intended tracker from remotes and configuration; pass the verified target explicitly.

File issues only in the project the user selected, never the skills package or upstream by accident. In a fork, `gh` can default to upstream: verify `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner` and use an explicit repo for writes.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number>`, then `gh pr view <number> --comments` (off a TTY, `--comments` prints only the comments, not the body), and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh api --paginate 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=open' --jq '.[] | select(.author_association | IN("OWNER","MEMBER","COLLABORATOR") | not) | {number, title, author: .user.login, author_association, labels: [.labels[].name]}'`.
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label`/`--remove-label`, `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either: resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue (see **Make an issue a sub-issue of a parent**). Where sub-issues aren't enabled, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: see **Blocking** under Conventions.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children (`gh issue list --state open`, scoped to the map's sub-issues / task list), drop any whose blocker has not satisfied the configured successful-completion predicate or which has an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`, the session's first write.
- **Resolve a decision**: when authorized and its answer satisfies the configured decision predicate, `gh issue comment <n> --body "<answer>"`, then `gh issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far. Implementation work follows its separate delivery/validation gates. Do not upload context to a gist unless explicitly authorized.
